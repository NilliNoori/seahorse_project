# Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of staff needed during various events, based on the available features in the dataset. By analyzing historical data, such as ticket scans, time of day, weather conditions and product sales. We seek to identify patterns that influence bar traffic and inventory demand.

We will also investigate correlations between features to better understand which factors lead to increased product demand. These insights will allow us to not only predict staffing needs more accurately, but also anticipate when more inventory is required. Ultimately, this will support more efficient planning, optimized staffing and reduced waste.
